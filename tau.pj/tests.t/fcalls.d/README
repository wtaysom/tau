fcalls is a set of tests for kernel interfaces for the file system.

The intent is to check basic functionality of a given file system by
using most of the file system interfaces or system calls.

Macros have been abused to make the tests easier to write.

Please see fcalls.h.

In the error reporting functions like PrError, warn, and fatal,
putting ':' at the end of the format string, causes errno to be
printed as part of the error message.
